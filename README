The entity struct was added; it is used to represent the player, but, in the future, may be useful for representing monsters.

    Masks are used on args to get whether the --load or --save switches were used.

The save and load functions were added, which load and save the rooms, and position of the player.

The initDisplay function was changed to initmap.

The sketchmap function was implemented, which draws a map onto the display array.

The place function was implemented, which places a dynamically allocated array of entities onto the display array.
